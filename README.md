## Hi there 👋, I'm Marcos Costa

As a former professional alpinist I am used to performing under pressure and finding solutions to hard and complex challenges. I am passionate about learning software solutions to solving real world problems. I strive to learn and improve daily building on what I have learned in the past. 

_"Success in not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts"_ -Winston Churchill
